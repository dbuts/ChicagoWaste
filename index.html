		<p>Yard waste that ends up in land fills greatly contributes to global warming, as the C02 is released into the atmosphere when not properly handled. 
		<br><br>
	Prime Chicago Waste Collection is a proposal to replace Chicago's current yard waste collection system with a bi-weekly collection during the fall season, using the existing garbage removal infrastructure. Funding for these extra routes will come from the mandating of a Chicago sold yard waste bag that is eco friendly, and durable enough to survive the curbside until being picked up.</p>
		<p>If more immediate yard waste pickup is needed, a simple webapplication can be used to request pickup. Visit our social media to learn more!</p>
